## Setup Instructions for Filesystem MCP Server

### Step 1: Create a Project and Set Up Credentials

1. Go to your preferred development environment or platform where you manage your projects.

2. Create a new project:
   - Use the option to create a new project.
   - Give your project a meaningful name, such as "Filesystem MCP Server Integration".

3. Configure any necessary credentials or access settings:
   - Ensure that you have the appropriate permissions to read from and write to directories, manage files, and perform metadata retrieval within your development environment.
   - If there are any specific API keys or tokens required for accessing filesystem operations, make sure to generate and store them securely.

### Step 2: Clone and Set Up the Server Code

1. Download and install [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) if it is not already installed on your system.

2. Open a terminal on your computer:
   - On macOS: Press **Command (âŒ˜)** + **Spacebar** to open Spotlight, type `Terminal`, and hit **Return**.
   - On Windows: Press **Windows** + **R**, type `cmd`, and hit **Enter**.

3. Clone the repository by copying and pasting the following command into the terminal and hitting **Return**/**Enter**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers.git mcp-filesystem-server
   ```

4. Navigate into the filesystem server directory by executing:
   ```bash
   cd mcp-filesystem-server/src/filesystem
   ```

5. Ensure that you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed, as it may be required for running JavaScript-based server scripts.

6. Install any necessary dependencies by running (this command assumes a Node.js environment):
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Step 3: Configure Environment for Filesystem Operations

1. Identify the directories you want to sandbox for read/write operations:
    - Make sure these directories are accessible by your development environment.
    - Ensure proper permissions are set to allow file operations within these directories.

2. Configure any additional settings in configuration files as needed:
    - Look for configuration files within the cloned repository that may need modification based on your setup requirements (e.g., paths or patterns).

3. If applicable, create symbolic links or shortcuts in your filesystem to facilitate easier access to frequently used directories.

### Step 4: Run and Authorize Access

1. Start the server by executing the main server script in your terminal:
    ```bash
    node ./server.js
    ```
   
2. Monitor terminal output messages indicating successful startup of the server.

3. If authorization steps are needed (e.g., OAuth), follow prompts given in terminal logs or web interfaces provided by your development platform.

4. Test basic file operations such as reading from a directory or writing a simple text file using built-in functionality of MCP Filesystem Server.

5. Confirm successful integration by verifying changes made through server operations in sandboxed directories reflect accurately on disk with expected metadata updates.

By following these steps, you should successfully integrate and configure an MCP Filesystem Server in your development environment for effective file management tasks!
