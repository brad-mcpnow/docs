Imagine transforming your AI coding assistant into a documentation expert that always knows the latest APIs, never hallucinates outdated methods, and provides version-specific code examples directly in your prompts. Context7 MCP server makes this possible by connecting your AI to real-time, up-to-date documentation from thousands of libraries and frameworks. Simply add "use context7" to your prompt and get accurate, current code examples instantly. This guide will walk you through the setup process step by step.

## What is MCP and why use it with Context7?

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) allows AI assistants like ChatGPT/Claude to interact with external tools and services. By setting up a Context7 MCP server, you unlock powerful code documentation capabilities that transform how you develop and debug:

- **Instant documentation lookup**: "Show me the latest authentication methods for the Stripe API v2023-10-16"
- **Version-specific guidance**: "What's changed in React 18.2 hooks compared to version 17.0?"
- **Cross-platform compatibility**: "How do I implement WebSocket connections in both Node.js and Python?"
- **Natural language queries**: "Find examples of handling file uploads with proper error handling in Express.js"
- **Real-time updates**: "Get the most current documentation for TypeScript decorators and their usage patterns"

Context7 bridges the gap between your AI coding assistant and the ever-evolving landscape of software documentation. Instead of manually searching through multiple documentation sites or working with outdated information, your AI can instantly access current, version-specific documentation from popular libraries and frameworks.

Whether you're exploring new APIs, debugging compatibility issues, or learning best practices, Context7 ensures your AI assistant has access to the most accurate and up-to-date technical information available. This means faster development cycles, fewer bugs from outdated examples, and more confident coding decisions backed by current documentation.
